# Executes commands at login post-zshrc.
#
# This file is sourced by login shells after zshrc, and thus, it should contain commands
# that need to execute at login. It is usually used for messages such as fortune, msgs,
# or for the creation of files.
#
# This is not the file to define aliases, functions, shell options, and key bindings. It
# should not change the shell environment.
